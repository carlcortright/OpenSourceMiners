## Description

Over time, the most popular programming languages have shifted dramatically. There have been trends with the rise and fall of different programming languages over time. However it can often be quite difficult to predict these fluctuations. So for this project, we have decided to dive into a large open-source dataset that looks into contributions to open-source software and try to map what we hope, will be an accurate representation of these trends. Acquired from [libraries.io](https://libraries.io/data), this dataset with over 397+ million rows, provides us with repository names, timestamps, programming languages, and many more attributes related to open source projects on the internet.

Our primary goal of this project is to gain insights about open source software. We will accomplish this goal by mining data from a dataset about open source projects. We will focus our work on four main areas: tracking trends in programming languages, analyzing how popular repositories have changed over time, how contributions to those repositories have changed over time, and also monitoring repository life cycles. We will use various data minining techniques and tools in order to accomplish this goal. More information about this process can be found in our final project paper **(insert link)**. 

## Questions and Answers

#### The primary *questions* we will consider during the duration of this project will focus on analyzing trends in open source projects.

1. **What insights can we gain to improve the open source community further?**
   - As we use various techniques to mine the data throughout the project, we hope to gain more information about the various languages used, the contributions to popular repositories, and the trends in dependencies which rely on those open source projects.
2. **How can we identify areas in the open source community that need improvement?**
   - This question will help us understand the missing gaps in the open source community. To find answers to this question, we will analyze trends in contributions and repositories to figure out areas of improvement within the open source community.
3. **Can we predict upcoming popular repositories?**
   - We hope to answer this question using all the information from the mined data. We would like to predict upcoming popular repositories based on all the insights we gain from the data analysis we will perform. Answering this question will be beneficial to understand the open source community.

#### Through various data mining tools and techniques we used, we were able to gain *answers* to those questions defined above.

## Application

In our application, we focus on how our conclusions will help us make better and more useful decisions regarding open source projects. Open source projects play a significant role in the development of software. Tens of thousands of open source projects run worldwide, and millions of users rely on open source software. Concluding applications based on our data analysis will help us better understand open source software that influences millions across the world.
