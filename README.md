## Description

## Questions 

The primary questions we will consider during the duration of this project will focus on analyzing trends in open source projects.

1. What insights can we gain to improve the open source community further?
   - As we use various techniques to mine the data throughout the project, we hope to gain more information about the various languages used, the contributions to popular repositories, and the trends in dependencies which rely on those open source projects.
2. How can we identify areas in the open source community that need improvement?
   - This question will help us understand the missing gaps in the open source community. To find answers to this question, we will analyze trends in contributions and repositories to figure out areas of improvement within the open source community.
3. Can we predict upcoming popular repositories?
   - We hope to answer this question using all the information from the mined data. We would like to predict upcoming popular repositories based on all the insights we gain from the data analysis we will perform. Answering this question will be beneficial to understand the open source community.
